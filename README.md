# User-Login-System

This program validates computer user-ids and passwords uses trees. A list of valid ids and passwords (unsorted) is read from a file and stored in a Binary Search Tree (BST) of UserInfo objects. When  user-ids and passwords are entered during execution, this BST is searched to determine whether they are legal.

   Input (file):     UserInfo records for valid users

   Input (keyboard): Ids and passwords of users logging in

   Output (screen):  Messages indicating whether user-ids and passwords are valid, as well as an alphabetical listing of all valid ids and                      passwords at the end of the run.

These are the operators that are overloaded >>, <<, ==, and < operators in the UserInfo class in order to accomplish this task.
